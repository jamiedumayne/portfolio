## Data visulisation at Dsposal
I spent 3 months working for the waste management company Dspsoal. I made maps of the location of every Household Waste Recycling Centre in the UK, and how long it takes for someone to drive to their nearest one.

## Machine learning at Leonardo
I spent 3 months carrying out an internship for the company Leonardo. I tested if pre-trained neural networks could be applied to radar data. Unforunately, due to the secretive nature of radar research I can't share the code I produced. However, I can talk about my work at Leonardo in slightly more detail in person.

## Other projects
To improve my data science skills I worked on a selection of projects based on datasets hosted on Kaggle. Links to all of these are below.
